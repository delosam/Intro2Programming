   <h1>Brief Introduction to The World Wide Web</h1>
     <p><b>The World Wide Web</b> in it's abbreviated form is <em>WWW</em>. It
     was created and introduced in the early 1990's. The World Wide Web is
     comprised of about 30 billion pages that are made up of the following:</p>
      <ul>
       <li>A collection of HTML documents</li>
       <li>HyperText Markup Language</li>
       <li>Hyperlinks</li>
     </ul>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h2>What Are the File Types Hosted on the Web?</h2>
     <p>There are quite a few file types that can be found on the Internet.
      Among them are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Plain Text</li>
        <li>HTML</li>
        <li>Images</li>
        <li>Video</li>
        <li>Music</li>
      </ul>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h2>What Are the Components to The Web?</h2>
     <p>The web is made of the following objects:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A living person</li>
        <li>A Computer</li>
        <li>A Browser to make call outs to pages</li>
        <li>The Internet</li>
        <li>Servers that hosts files</li>
      </ul>
     <p>So how does an individual call out to a page like
     <a href = "https://www.udacity.com" target = "-blank"><strong>Udacity
     </strong></a> for example to see what they have to offer? The individual
     will open his browser of choice. I personally prefer <b>Google Chrome</b>,
     Internet Explorer has seen better days,in my opinion. The individual will
     type the web address in the address bar and hit enter on the keyboard.
     The browser will search the Internet, and eventually locate a server
     hosting the specific file that was requested by the individual. This is
     probably a good segue for the next section - <b>discussing web pages and
     what they are made of up of</b>.</p>

    <h2>What Are Webpages?</h2>
      <p><b>Webpages</b> are files that are made of up <b>HTML</b>. <em>HTML</em>
       is short for hypertext markup language, and is apparently fairly easy
       to use according to the pros or in this case, Scott our trainer in the
       <b>IPND</b>. Webpages consist of the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Text content (what you see)</li>
          <li>Markup (What it looks like in the browser window)</li>
          <li>Refereces to other documents (images and videos)</li>
          <li>Links (to other pages)</li>
        </ul>
       <p>The <b>hypertext language</b> is made of opening and closing tags that
       surround some content. However, there are some exceptions to that rule.
       There are other tags known as void tags. These tags do not contain
       content and therefore do not need closing tags. Below are the tags that
        were introduced during this introduction. And since the image tag
       was mentioned during this training event, I created a <b>PNG</b> file
       and included it.<br><br><img src = "images/project1_udacity.png"</p>
    </div>

      <p>I think that pretty much covers the notes I jotted down. Hopefully,
        I covered most of it. Can't wait to learn some more stuff! <b>THANKS!
        </b></p>
